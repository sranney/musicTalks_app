# musicTalks_app

A Node.js, Socket.io and MVC chat application that also uses MongoDB, and Handlebars to generate personalized content delivery and real-time chats.  This is a passion project, combining my love of music with my love of coding. A music social network site that also facilitates musical discovery through band profile pages complete with YouTube and Spotify media.

No BootStrap or any other CSS or JS plugin has been used in this site.



Currently this is just the initial model. There are some things I am going to be adding and fixing in it soon.
